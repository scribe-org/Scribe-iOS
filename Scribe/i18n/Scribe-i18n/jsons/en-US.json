Third-Party Source Code\n\nThis SERVICE was based on third-party code. All source code used in the creation of this SERVICE comes from sources that allow its full use in the manner done so by the SERVICE. Specifically, the basis of this project was the project Custom Keyboard by Ethan Sarif-Kattan.
