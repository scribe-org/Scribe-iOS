### Scribe language keyboards for iOS

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS and iPadOS keyboards for language learners. Features include translation **`(beta)`**, verb conjugation and word annotation that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence.

Scribe is fully open-source and does not collect usage data or ask for system access. Feature data is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and stored in-app, meaning Scribe is a highly responsive experience that does not require an internet connection.

The App Store videos, images and text can be found in [Resources/AppStore](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Resources/AppStore/). Contributions to improve them are welcome, but please [open an issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/new) to check before.

# Setup [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="setup"></a>

Users access Scribe language keyboards through the following:

- Download Scribe from the [App Store](https://www.apple.com/app-store/) (submission in progress)
- Settings -> General -> Keyboard -> Keyboards -> Add New Keyboard
- Select Scribe and choose from the available language keyboards
- When typing press `🌐` to select keyboards

# Features [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="features"></a>

Scribe keyboard features are accessed via the `Scribe key` at the top left of any Scribe keyboard. Pressing this key gives the user three new selectable options: `Translate`, `Conjugate` and `Plural`. These keys allow for words to be queried and inserted into the text field followed by a space.

Current features include:

### Translation [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="translation"></a>

The **`beta`** `Translate` feature can translate single words or phrases from English into the language of the current keyboard when the `return` key is pressed.

Those interested in improving this feature can see the [Translation project](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/projects/1). The goal is that `Translate` will provide options for entered words where a user can use grammatical categories and synonyms to select the best option [(see issue)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/49). Then the feature will expand to allow translations from system and chosen languages. More advanced methods will be planned once this feature is out of **`beta`**.

As of now translations ([P5972](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P5972), [Q7553](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7553)) are not widely available on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) [(see issue)](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/40). The current functionality is thus based on [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) machine translations of words queried from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). The ultimate goal is for the translations and synonyms to all be directly queried.

### Verb Conjugation [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="verb-conjugation"></a>

With the `Conjugate` feature, a user is presented with the grammar charts for an entered verb instead of the keyboard. Pressing an example in the charts inserts the chosen conjugation into the text field.

### Noun Plurals [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="noun-plurals"></a>

The `Plural` feature allows a user to enter a noun and then insert its plural when the `return` key is pressed.

### Word Annotation [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="word-annotation"></a>

Scribe further annotates words in the preview bar to help users understand the context of what they're typing. Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a given word and pressed space or by pressing the `Scribe key` while it is selected. The hope is that annotation will help a user remember grammar rules even when not using Scribe.

#### Nouns

Scribe annotates nouns in the preview bar according to the following conventions:

- Feminine nouns are colored red 🟥 and marked with (F)
- Masculine nouns are colored blue 🟦 and marked with (M)
- Neutral nouns are colored green 🟩 and marked with (N)
- Plural nouns are colored orange 🟧 and marked with (PL)
- Nouns meeting more than one of the above criteria are marked with all their forms

#### Prepositions

Scribe also annotates the grammatical cases of prepositions in the preview bar if there is a relation in the given language.

### Keyboard Functionality [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="keyboard-functionality"></a>

The goal is for Scribe to have all the functionality of system keyboards. See the [Base Keyboard Features project](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/projects/6) if interested in helping.

# Supported Languages [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="supported-languages"></a>

The Scribe team has interest in creating keyboards for all languages of interest. The following table shows the supported languages and the amount of data available for each on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Based on the available data, the next languages that the Scribe team could focus on are Russian ([queries](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Data/Russian/), [issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/6)) and English ([queries](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/Data/English/), [issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/7)).

| Language | Nouns | Verbs | Translations\* | Prepositions† |
| :------- | ----: | ----: | -------------: | ------------: |
| German   |  27K+ |   3K+ |           65K+ |           190 |
| Spanish  |   8K+ |    65 |           65K+ |            NA |

`*` Given the current **`beta`** status where words are machine translated.

`†` Only for languages for which preposition annotation is needed.

# To-Do [`⇧`](#contents) <a id="to-do"></a>

Work that is in progress or could be implemented is tracked in the [Issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues) and [Projects](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/projects). Please see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you are interested in contributing to Scribe-iOS. Also note the use of the `--priority--` label that indicates which issues are most important.

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar JSON files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the queries themselves will be changed and ran before an update. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe.
