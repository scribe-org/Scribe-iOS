## iOS app with keyboards for language learners

**Scribe-iOS** is a pack of iOS and iPadOS keyboards for language learners. Features include translation **`(beta)`**, verb conjugation and word annotation that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence.

Scribe is fully open-source and does not collect usage data or ask for system access. Feature data is sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and stored in-app, meaning Scribe is a highly responsive experience that does not require an internet connection.

> [!NOTE]\
> The [contributing](#contributing) section has information for those interested, with the articles and presentations in [featured by](#featured-by) also being good resources for learning more about Scribe.

Also available on [Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) (WIP), [Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop) (planned) and for the data processes see [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data).

Scribe does not accept direct edits to the grammar files as they are sourced from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Edits can be discussed and the [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) queries will be changed. If there is a problem with one of the files, then the fix should be made on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) and not on Scribe. Feel free to let us know that edits have been made by [opening a data issue](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=data&template=data_wikidata.yml) or contacting us in the [issues for Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/issues) and we'll be happy to integrate them!

<a id="environment-setup"></a>

# Environment Setup [`‚áß`](#contents)

Scribe-iOS is developed using the [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) coding language. Those new to Swift or wanting to develop their skills are more than welcome to contribute! The first step on your Swift journey would be to read through the [Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/index.html). The general steps to setting up a development environment are:

1. Download [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

2. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the [Scribe-iOS repo](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), clone your fork, and configure the remotes:

> [!NOTE]
>
> <details><summary>Consider using SSH</summary>
>
> <p>
>
> Alternatively to using HTTPS as in the instructions below, consider SSH to interact with GitHub from the terminal. SSH allows you to connect without a user-pass authentication flow.
>
> To run git commands with SSH, remember then to substitute the HTTPS URL, `https://github.com/...`, with the SSH one, `git@github.com:...`.
>
> - e.g. Cloning now becomes `git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Scribe-iOS.git`
>
> GitHub also has their documentation on how to [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) üîë
>
> </p>
> </details>

```bash
# Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory.
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Scribe-iOS.git
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory.
cd Scribe-iOS
# Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream".
git remote add upstream https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS.git
```

- Now, if you run `git remote -v` you should see two remote repositories named:
  - `origin` (forked repository)
  - `upstream` (Scribe-iOS repository)

3. (Optional) Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and its hooks to check for and correct common errors in commits:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# pre-commit run --all-files
```

4. Open the Scribe-iOS directory in Xcode

5. In order to run Scribe on an emulator:

   - Read the [documentation from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/running-your-app-in-simulator-or-on-a-device) if need be
   - In the top bar select Scribe as the scheme
   - If you're debugging you'll need to select the keyboard you're testing as the scheme (see the [note on debugging](#note-on-debugging) below)
   - Select a device to run the app on
   - Press the run button marked `Start the active scheme`
   - From here code edits that are made will be reflected in the app each time the active scheme is restarted

6. Build the developer documentation by selecting `Product` > `Build Documentation` (^‚áß‚åòD)

> [!NOTE]
> Feel free to contact the team in the [iOS room on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ScribeiOS:matrix.org) if you're having problems getting your environment setup!

> [!WARNING]\
> **Note on Debugging:**
> Because Scribe is a keyboard extension, the Xcode debugger doesn't work as expected when debugging a regular app. Please see the [note on debugging](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#note-on-debugging) in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to get it working properly.

<a id="supported-languages"></a>

# Supported Languages [`‚áß`](#contents)

Scribe's goal is functional, feature-rich keyboards for all languages. You can check the currently available languages and data for Scribe applications on our website at [scri.be/docs/server/available-data](https://scri.be/docs/server/available-data).

See [scribe_data/wikidata/language_data_extraction](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data/tree/main/src/scribe_data/wikidata/language_data_extraction) for queries in the [Scribe-Data](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Data) project for currently supported languages and those that have substantial data on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). Also see the [`new keyboard`](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+keyboard%22) label in the [Issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues) for keyboards that are currently in progress or being discussed, and [suggest a new keyboard](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/new?assignees=&labels=new+keyboard&template=new_keyboard.yml&title=Add+%3Clanguage%3E+keyboard) if you don't see it being worked on already!

<a id="keyboard-features"></a>

# Keyboard Features [`‚áß`](#contents)

Keyboard features are accessed via the `Scribe key` at the top left of any Scribe keyboard. Pressing this key gives the user three new selectable options: `Translate`, `Conjugate` and `Plural` in the keyboard's language. These keys allow for words to be queried and inserted into the text field followed by a space.

**Current features include:**

### Translation [`‚áß`](#contents)

The **`beta`** `Translate` feature can translate single words or phrases from English into the language of the current keyboard when the `return` key is pressed. The goal is that `Translate` will eventually provide options for entered words where a user can use grammatical categories and synonyms to select the best option. Then the feature will expand to allow translations from system and chosen languages. More advanced methods will be planned once this feature is out of **`beta`**.

As of now translations are not widely available on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). The current functionality is thus based on [ü§ó Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) machine translations of words queried from [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/). The ultimate goal is for the translations to be directly queried.

### Verb Conjugation [`‚áß`](#contents)

With the `Conjugate` feature, a user is presented with the grammar charts for an entered verb instead of the keyboard. Pressing an example in the charts inserts the chosen conjugation into the text field.

### Noun Plurals [`‚áß`](#contents)

The `Plural` feature allows a user to enter a noun and then insert its plural into the text field when the `return` key is pressed.

### Word Annotation [`‚áß`](#contents)

Scribe further annotates words in the command bar to help users understand the context of what they're typing. Annotations are displayed once a user has typed a given word and pressed space, after commands, by pressing the `Scribe key` while it is selected as well as under autocompletions and autosuggestions. The hope is that annotation will help a user remember grammar rules even when not using Scribe.

#### Nouns

Scribe annotates nouns in the command bar according to the following conventions:

- Feminine: colored red üü• and marked with (F)
- Masculine: colored blue üü¶ and marked with (M)
- Common: colored purple üü™ and marked with (C)
- Neutral: colored green üü© and marked with (N)
- Plural: colored orange üüß and marked with (PL)
- More than one: marked with all their forms

The above form abbreviations are translated into their equivalents in the keyboard's language.

#### Prepositions

Scribe also annotates the grammatical cases (accusative, dative, etc) of prepositions in the command bar if there is a relation in the given language.

### Pronoun Selection [`‚áß`](#contents)

Annotations for preposition cases can also be pressed to provide a conjugation display where the user can select the proper pronoun for the given case. The conjugation view will also provide appropriate interfaces to subset the available pronouns based on the desired subject and object combinations to help the user make the correct choice.

### Base Functionality [`‚áß`](#contents)

The goal is for Scribe to have all the functionality of system keyboards. See the [issues](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/) if interested in helping.

<details><summary><strong>Current base features include:</strong></summary>
<p>

- iPhone and iPad support
- Dynamic layouts for cross-device performance
- Portrait and landscape modes
- Dark mode compatibility
- Autocompletion based on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) sourced words
- Autosuggestion based on [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) derived relationships
- Emoji autocompletions and autosuggestions based on [Unicode CLDR](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr) sourced emojis
- Autocorrect (WIP - see [Autocorrect](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS/issues/2) issue)
- Auto-capitalization following `.`, `?` and `!`
- The double space period shortcut
- Typing symbols and numbers followed by a space returns keyboard to letters
- Hold-to-select characters for letters and symbols
- Key pop up views for letters and symbols
